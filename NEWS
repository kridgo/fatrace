## [0.18.0] - 2025-01-19
 - Add -u/--user option to show [uid:gid] in events (thanks Gabriel Kulp!)
 - Truncate overly long --command matches
 - Turn invalid FID type error into warning

## [0.17.0] - 2022-11-11
 - Work around kernel bug with blocking FAN_REPORT_FID with btrfs
 - Improve event formatting
 - Avoid ELOOP errors when monitoring symlinks
 - Monitor ZFS volumes; thanks achims311

## [0.16.3] - 2021-05-15
 - Always use line buffering
 - Fix fd leak with `-f` event type filtering. Thanks Stefan Dotterweich!
   (#8, LP: #1858305)

## [0.16.2] - 2021-03-12
 - Use line buffering with --output to get live logs (#6)
 - Make open_by_handle_at() failures non-fatal (#2)

## [0.16.1] - 2020-12-28
 - Move manpage to section 8
 - Clean up definition of _GNU_SOURCE

## [0.16] - 2020-08-22
- Avoid most "unknown" process names on process exit
- tests: Accept split file rename events (Debian #963714, LP: #1885188)

## [0.15] - 2019-11-03
- Fix fd leak with -C when building without FAN_REPORT_FID support

## [0.14] - 2019-10-01
- Add support for directory events: file creation, rename/move, delete. This
  requires Linux 5.1 (FAN_REPORT_FID support), on older kernels fall back to
  the old mode. (Debian #940629, LP: #1371394)
- power-usage-report: Fix regexp substitution (LP: #1683164)
- Drop O_LARGEFILE workaround, fixes cross-building
  (Debian #784983, LP: #1755787)

## [0.13] - 2018-03-25
- Fix #include file for major() and minor() to avoid a warning with recent
  glibc.

## [0.12] - 2016-04-25
- Fix crash introdued in 0.10 when using the -p option. Thanks Yuriy M.
  Kaminski! (Debian #817247, LP: #1563919)

## [0.11] - 2015-11-08
- Make compatible with musl libc. Thanks Christian Neukirchen!
- Add -C/--command option to only show events for a particular command. Thanks
  Christian Neukirchen!

## [0.10] - 2015-04-29
- Add --filter/-f option to only show selected event types. Thanks to Bryce
  Nesbitt!

## [0.9] - 2014-11-07
- power-usage-report: Adjust parsing to also work for powertop 2.6.

## [0.8] - 2014-09-23
- The previous O_LARGEFILE change to fix "Value too large for defined data
  type" error was ineffective, as in userspace this value is 0 on the affected
  platforms. Use the real numeric value to work around the problem for systems
  which run an older kernel that does not yet have the real fix.
  (LP: #1372873)

## [0.7] - 2014-08-07
- Use O_LARGEFILE to fix "Value too large for defined data type" error with
  large files on some platforms. (LP: #1161989)
- Increase buffer size to 256 KiB. (LP: #1312095)

## [0.6] - 2014-01-07
Bug fixes:
- More careful check of uninteresting mount points, only consider those with a
  '/' in it. Thanks Heinrich Schuchardt!
- power-usage-report: Fix output parsing for PowerTOP 2.5. (LP: #1265142)

## [0.5] - 2013-04-11
Improvements:
- Some code optimizations, thanks Yann Droneaud!
- power-usage-report: Use current powertop 2 (LP: #937703)
- power-usage-report: Use Python 3
- power-usage-report: Include "Process Device Activity" section from powertop

## [0.4] - 2012-02-21
Improvements:
- Add power-usage-report script which uses fatrace and powertop-1.13 to
  collect data about file accesses, wakeups, and device stats and generates a
  developer/power-user oriented report which can be used for identifying power
  usage problems.

## [0.3] - 2012-02-17
Bug fixes:
- Fix --ignore-pid short option (-p, not -i) in --help.
- Tell apart closing for reading ("C") and closing for writing ("CW"). Point
  this out in the manpage.

## [0.2] - 2012-02-15
Improvements:
- --output does not overwrite already existing files.
- Some code cleanup and robustification, thanks Yann Droneaud!
- Proper handling of Control-C (SIGINT), thanks Yann Droneaud!
- When specifying --timestamp twice, print time as seconds since epoch, which
  is easier for automatic post-processing.

Bug fixes:
- Listen to "close" events as well.
- Simplify and robustify determination of path names. This also fixes the
  races which led to many events being shown with device/inode only.

## [0.1] - 2012-02-07
Initial version.
